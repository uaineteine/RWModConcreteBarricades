# Expanded Materials-Concrete Barricade

Why make a simple wooden barricade when concrete is available and a stronger and quick setting material.

## Content

This mod adds a fortified barricade to the security tab:

	- standard size (1x1)
	
	- extended Hitpoints: 440
	
	- quicker to build: 220 work
	
	- flameproof

Unlockable with research after concrete making.

Also patches in a variant of the barricade that can be built out of rock powder, no stat differences.
